New students are registered from 8:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. each school day. Parents must provide proof of residency, birth certificate, immunization records and grades from previous schools. After registration, an appointment with a counselor will be set up in order to create the student’s schedule.</p><h4>Awarding of Credit</h4><p>Any student transferring from a school accredited by the State Department of Education to another school accredited by the State Department of Education shall be placed into the same grade the student would have been in had the student remained at the former school.<br>Any student transferring from a school that is not accredited by the State Department of Education to a school that is accredited by the State Department of Education, shall be evaluated by the staff of that accredited school to determine that student’s prop er placement in the accredited school.<br>When the appropriate documentation of work completed by the student is given to the school counselor, the work and documentation will be evaluated by a committee composed of a counselor, appropriate department faculty members, and the grade level assistant principal. The decision to award credit in a specific subject area will be determined by considering the following:</p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">The course work aligns with course offerings of BPS.</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">There is evidence of mastery of the standards for the course being considered</span></p><p>The committee may take any of the following actions on a course-by-course basis:</p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">Grant credit contingent upon the student’s passing a subsequent course,</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">make a satisfactory score on a standardized test</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">provide additional information to substantiate  the student has knowledge of a specific subject area; or</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">Deny credit.</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">Any credit awarded for homeschool courses will not be calculated into the student’s GPA.</span></p><h4>Transfer from Other Public U.S. Schools</h4><p>When a student transfers from another accredited public high school, high school credits and grade point average earned will be accepted and treated  in a manner similar to credits and grade point average earned In Bentonville Public Schools High Schools. Bentonville Public Schools High Schools will record courses from the previous school with the designated credits on the transcript. Credit cannot be given for a course that shows as “no credit” on the incoming transcript.<br>Weighted credit will be given ONLY for the transfer of successfully completed year-long Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) courses with verification of AP/IB exams taken.  All other courses will receive no additional weight in determining the grade point average for a student who transfers from a public school.<br>If a student transfers from a non-accredited public high school, a committee of appropriate personnel to include a counselor, department chair, and administrator will review and determine the awarding of credits and grades.  It will be the responsibility of the parent or guardian of the transferring student to provide school officials with a copy of the most recent official studen t transcript, a copy of the high school course description book, and graded samples of the student’s work for the review of the school committee.</p><h4>Transfer Students from Private U.S. Schools</h4><p>Credits and letter grades from accredited, private schools will be accepted. When a question regarding accreditation of the p rivate school is an issue, an accreditation review committee of staff will determine whether or not credits/grades will be granted. Transferred courses from the private school that are in the BPS Core Curriculum (as shown in the Course Guide) or in the state’s listing of core curriculum courses will receive letter grades and credits. Other courses will receive credit, but will not calculate in the student’s GPA.</p><h4>Transfer from a School in a Foreign Country</h4><p>When a student transfers from an accredited American school in a foreign country, high school credits will be accepted and treated in a manner similar to transfer from either a public or private school in the U.S. When a student transfers from a foreign school, credit will be accepted and treated  in a manner similar to transfers from home school. Credit will be assigned, but courses will not<br>be used to calculate GPA, honors graduation or class ranking. When a student transfers from a foreign school and was enrolled in an accredited IB program, high school credits will be accepted and treated  in a manner similar to transfers from either a public or<br>private school in the U.S.</p><p class="s6">7</p><h4>Foreign Exchange Students</h4><p>Bentonville Public Schools welcomes foreign exchange students to our campuses.  Our students will be better for having the opportunity to learn about other countries, cultures and customs.

Home schooled students whose parents’ domicile, as defined in AAA Rules, is within the Bentonville Public School District’s boundaries may participate in school extracurricular activities subject to the requirements set forth by Act 1469. While Act 1469 prescribes the criteria for initial and continuing eligibility, actual participation will be dependent upon the same try-out criteria, or other requirements as may be applicable, as for any regularly enrolled student.<br>In realizing this goal, home school students will be allowed to participate in interscholastic activities with Bentonville Public Schools, under the following conditions:</p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">The home schooled student or his or her legal guardian advises the Principal of the school in writing of the student’s request to participate in the interscholastic activity before the signup, tryout, or participation deadlines established for the students enrolled in the Bentonville Public School District.</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">The home school student must report to the Bentonville Public School District within the first eleven (11) days of the fall or spring semester.</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">The home school student shall demonstrate academic eligibility by obtaining: a minimum test score of the thirtieth percentile on the Stanford Achievement Test Series, Tenth Edition, in the previous twelve (12) months, or another nationally recognized norm-reference test (approved by the State Board of Education).</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">The home school student shall meet tryout criteria.</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">Continued eligibility requires the home school student to be enrolled in and regularly attend, at least one class period during their semester of participation.</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">The home school student must complete any required permission slips, waivers, physical exams, and drug testing that is required.</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">The home school student must pay any participation fee traditional students enrolled in the District pay for the same extracurricular activity.</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">The home school student must meet all other requirements for continued eligibility identified in the AAA Handbook.</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">The home school student must comply with the Bentonville Public School Handbooks and any supplementary requirements or conditions for participation in extracurricular activities and standards of behavior and codes of conduct.</span></p><p>Extracurricular activities are defined as: any school sponsored program where students from one or more schools meet, work, perform, practice under supervision outside of the regular class time, or are competing for the purpose of receiving an award, rating, recognition, or criticism, or qualification for additional competition.

Failed AP, IB, or honors courses will be repeated  as regular classes, if offered.</p><h4>Credit Recovery</h4><p>The purpose of the credit recovery classes is to provide students who have failed an academic course the opportunity to retak e the course and earn credit toward high school graduation requirements. These courses are taught through computer-based coursework. These classes are offered during the school day and as night school courses and summer school courses.</p><h4>Summer School</h4><p>Bentonville High School may offer limited summer school courses.

It has been designed to address the intellectual, social, emotional and physical well-being of students. The program, has gained recognition and respect from the world’s leading universities. And, a growing number of American universities are offering special scholarships, additional course hours, and advanced undergraduate standing to students whom have earned the IB Diploma.<br>To complete<span><img width="3" height="19" src="BHS_Course_Guide_17-18/Image_023.png"></span>and possibly earn the IB Diploma, students must complete The Diploma Programme Core (see next section), students must choose one subject from groups 1 to 5 and either an arts subject from group 6, or a second subject from groups 1 to 5.

In this course on critical thinking, students inquire into the fundamental nature of knowing by exploring ways of knowing (WAKs) and areas of knowledge (AOKs).</span></h4><h4>Creativity, activity, service (CAS) <span class="p">involves students in a range of activities alongside their academic studies throughout the Diploma Program. The three strands of CAS enhance students’ personal and interpersonal development through experiential learning and enable journeys of self-discovery.</span></h4><p class="s8">VERY IMPORTANT: There are substantial student registration and course fees charged by the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) for the administration of IB courses at BHS. The Bentonville School District currently pays these fees for any student enrolled in the full IB Diploma or in the requisite number of individual  IB courses. As such, students attempting to engage in the IB Programme at any capacity are required – along with their parents/guardians – to sign an IB Course Agreement form prior to actual enrollment in the courses.</p><p class="s4">COURSE DESCRIPTIONS</p><a id="DigitalLearning"><p class="s19">Digital Learning Courses</p></a><p><span><img width="716" height="31" src="BHS_Course_Guide_17-18/Image_025.png"></span><br>The following BHS courses meet the Digital Learning Course requirement set for the class of 2018 and after.

Additionally, students have opportunities to view elective courses which, coupled with course studies, allow students to create an outline of the courses they need and want to take throughout high school in or order to prepare CAP.

Students explore the works of several American artists who work with a variety of techniques and exposes students to the US history that was taking place at the time the artworks were created which influenced the artists’ creations.  Students watch videos and read articles about events in US history as well as about the artists themselves.  Students are required to complete online critiques of artists’ works and be involved in online discussion forums based on readings and videos about the artists’ lives, works, and historical events that influenced them.

Driving that increase in knowledge is a world of technology that constantly expands human capabilities.  These facts mean that for your generation, po st- secondary education will be a necessity.<br>The decisions you make now as you consider or revise a four-year graduation plan as well as actions you take throughout high school will greatly affect your future.  To increase your potential for fulfilling a successful and prosperous future, you are encou raged to:</p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">Take the most challenging courses available to you – Especially consider taking high-level mathematics and science courses.</span></p><p>Research shows that completing a mathematics course beyond the level of Algebra II more than doubles the likelihood that a student who begins college will actually complete a bachelor’s degree.  Completing multiple laboratory-based science courses also increases your chances of finishing college.  Of course, research also shows that completing higher-level mathematics and science courses has a direct correlation with higher ACT or SAT scores.</p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">Concentrate on making the best grades you can.</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">Consider taking Advanced Placement courses. Taking and successfully completing Advanced Placement courses in high</span></p><p>school is highly correlated with completing a bachelor’s degree and achieving higher ACT/SAT scores.</p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">Get involved in some activity that will help you develop special skills. Your interest could be a sport, music, art, volunteering, or an academic competition.  You will need some interest to balance a focus on academics, and you will discover that most colleges place some importance on involvement in an activity in their admissions considerations.</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">Develop strong study skills now so that you will be prepared to face the next stage of formal education.</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">Read. The College Board advises you to read at least thirty minutes beyond your required study and homework every day.</span></p><p>Choose books, magazines, newspapers, etc. of interest to you to ensure you will set aside time to read.</p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">Begin to think now about what careers might best suit your abilities and interests so that you can enroll in classes that will prepare you for continuing education.</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">Increase your technology skills. In the near future, virtually every job in our society will require skills with “information-</span></p><p>processing technology.”</p><p class="s6">61</p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">Commit to learning how to acquire – and use – information.  With knowledge increasing rapidly, being able to access and apply information will be a critically important skill.</span></p><p>With college education most likely in your future, it is important that you also consider what matters most in college admissions. <b>The most recent survey of college admissions officials showed that courses selected was almost twice as important as any othe r admissions criteria at most colleges</b>. Ranking significantly behind the level of courses taken were college entrance examination score, class rank, and overall grades.  Most colleges will tell you that they are interested in the strength of a student’s c urriculum and in students who challenge themselves by taking honors and Advanced Placement classes. If a high school offers these classes and a student decided not to take them, it shows that the student did not rise to the challenge.<br>As you consider your high school graduation plan, BHS staff encourages you to “rise to the challenge” of preparing for success in the<br>future by making the right choices today.</p><p class="s9">Success 1.0</p><h4>Preparing a Plan for Graduation and Beyond</h4><p>In Success 1.0, all BHS freshmen explore their interests, abilities, and future goals to create a 10-year plan. Looking ahead to where the student would like to be at the age of 25, a student in Success 1.0 backward plans their post-secondary years and the four years of high school. You will make many decisions about your four-year high school program of study. You are urged to consider each decision carefully. In selecting a program of study, you will want to consider all the possibilities. Realize that this is one of the most important    decisions you will make during the next several years.  There are certain steps to follow that can help you make your choices. In Success 1.0, you will</p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">Find out all you can about the courses offered.</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">Compare the courses.  Think about yourself and how each course might help you reach your goals.</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">Consider the advantages and disadvantages of each course.  Weigh these carefully.</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">Choose the courses that best align with your goals.</span></p><h4>I<u>n Success 1.0, you will also have the opportunity to:</u></h4><h4>Learn about Your High School’s Programs</h4><p>Your counselor and teachers will be helpful in advising you more specifically about the high school programs of studies offered.  Find out:</p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">The requirements for graduation</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">The courses required to begin certain sequences of courses</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">The elective courses you may take that are not required</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">The kinds of education or work for which the program can prepare you.</span></p><h4>Learn about Careers</h4><p>You probably will not be ready for several years to choose a specific career.  In planning your high school program of study, however, you will need to consider courses which seem interesting to you. You will need to know about the education required for careers that are of interest to you.</p><h4>Learn about Yourself</h4><p>To make wise choices, you also will need to understand yourself and your goals for the future.  It is important, therefore, t o take time to learn more about yourself.  Here are some questions to answer which can help you understand yourself better.</p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">In which subjects do I do well in school?</span></p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">What do I do well outside of school?</span></p><h4>My Abilities</h4><p class="s20"> <span class="p">Which talents do I have?

You will be meeting new students, teachers, principals, and other faculty members.  Most likely, you also will have to learn about the rules of a new school and find your way around a larger school building. You will take new courses and start new activities. You will find that you will be expected to take more responsibility for your own decisions, school work, and actions.<br>An important part of your responsibilities in high school will be to choose and take courses to prepare yourself for the future. Remember:  your high school program of study and your success in it will affect what you may do after your graduate.<br>Additionally, both the College Board and ACT websites provide excellent guides for career planning. The College Board website even includes an online Career Questionnaire that will point you to possible careers based on responses to sections on temperament s, abilities, working conditions, education, interest areas, salary requirements, and future demand for the employment area The ACT website encourages parents and students to work together in a career planning process that is developed in six steps.  As you progress through high school, continue to visit these websites that continue to expand their guidance for students and their parents.</p><h4>Think about Your Future</h4><p>Perhaps you have already begun to think about what to do after high school. You most likely are considering going to college. You may be wondering about attending another type of school, such as a vocational technical school. You may be thinking of preparing for a job or for a military service.  Perhaps you are not sure what you want to do.</p><h4>Learn Which Careers Require Education after High School</h4><p>You do not have to make a final decision now about your plans after high school because you will have many experiences during the next four years that will affect your choices. You may need time to explore many possibilities before deciding what you will do.  You will, however, have to choose a high school program of studies. In choosing your program, it is important to remember that almost every career requires a college education or future vocational-technical training after high school.</p><h4>Who Can Help You Plan?</h4><p>Your parents, Success 1.0 teacher, seminar teacher, counselor, and even people who are working in your career field of interest ca n help you plan for your future.<br>Your parents may be your best advisers in developing a graduation plan. They understand your personality and abilities.  They know your interests, likes, dislikes, and strengths.  They also can tell you about things they have learned from their own education and work, which can help you in making decisions. After you and your parents have read this section of the book, talk with them.<br>Discuss with them your thoughts and concerns about high school and your future.</p><p class="s6">63</p><p>Other people who know you well, such as your relatives and friends, can also help you. Consider getting their ideas.<br>Your school counselor can assist you to better understand yourself, your goals, high school courses, and careers.  Be sure to meet with your counselor for help in deciding which direction to take in high school.<br>You can get ideas from your teachers, too. BHS teachers are most familiar with the courses that are offered here, and they can guide you in making decisions about your program of study. They know the work you have done in their subjects and will be able to m ake suggestions about your graduation plan.<br>There may be some careers that seem interesting to you. If there are, talk with people in those careers to get information for planning your program of studies.  They can tell you about their work and the kind of education needed for it. You may want to use this information in choosing courses you will take. Most important, remember that you will be leaving high school at a time in which information and technology are rapidly changing. Thus, you should take as challenging courses as possible to be prepared for continued formal education and for life.</p><p class="s19">College Planning Timeline</p><p><span><img width="716" height="31" src="BHS_Course_Guide_17-18/Image_076.png"></span></p><p class="s9">Freshman Year</p><p class="s20"> <span class="p">Plan your four-year graduation plan.
